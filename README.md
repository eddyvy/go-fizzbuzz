# FIZZBUZZ WITH GO !

Just a little program to run the FizzBuzz exercise done with GO

## How it works?

Easy, just use the `go run main.go` and you will be asked to enter the number of the list.

Note: it uses an uint64 so the max number is as specified in [https://golang.org/ref/spec#Numeric_types](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Numeric_types)
